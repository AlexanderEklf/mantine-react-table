## Installation

> `mantine-react-table` V1 requires **Mantine V5** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Mantine, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mantine/core` (v5)
> 2.  `@mantine/hooks` (v5)
> 3.  `@mantine/dates` (v5)
> 4.  `@tabler/icons` (> v1.118)
> 5.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 6.  `dayjs` (v1.11)
> 7.  `react` and `react-dom` (v17 or v18)

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `mantine-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `highlight-words`
