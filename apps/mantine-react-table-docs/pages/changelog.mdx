## Changelog

### V1

### Pre 1.0 Breaking changes

- Moved from @tabler/icons v1 to @table-icons/react v2

## Roadmap

Mantine React Table v1 is slated to release a stable v1.0 based on Mantine v5.7+ by the end of February 2023. (Pretty soon!)

Shortly after that (March 2023), Mantine React Table v2 will be released based on Mantine v6. This will be a major release with breaking changes, though most of those breaking changes will be related to the Mantine v6 release itself.
